        <h3>Test Autofill</h3>
        <p>
            Autofill by both browsers and browser extensions brings convenience and organization to the web. As
            applications become more complicated, so do the types of data and layouts of input elements. The following
            workflows demonstrate common form patterns.

        <h4>The Everything Form</h4>
        <p>
            You may have to go through the workflows once to save credentials for this site. For that, you can use the
            Everything Form.

        <h3>Prevent Autofill</h3>
        <p>
            There are scenarios where autofill is inappropriate and should be disabled, like when the expected data for
            a form is unrelated to the browser's user. These situations tend to occur in business applications
            (like a data entry form), but also exist in consumer-facing products (like a two-factor auth code, or an
            incident report form).
        </p>
        <p>
            There is an unfortunate arms-race between browser developers and website developers over the ability
            to disable autofill. There are many email chains and bug reports that discuss the motivations at length, so
            it suffices to say that when a developer considers modifying autofill behavior, they must consider both
            usability for the end user and the application's intended workflow.
        </p>

        <h4>HTML Standard</h4>
        <p>
            The standard way to disable autofill is to set the autocomplete attribute to &quot;off&quot;. This is almost
            universally disrespected by browsers, especially in login fields.
